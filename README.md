mk docs overwrites html with each build so some features have to be added in the site folder (html files) after running mkdocs build and before pushing. those include:

Sections in TOC,
removing mkdocs water mark,
adding intercom widget,
make not turn color after click if (can try git ignore in css),
and image maps 

 - FOR NEXT ITERATION: messagemap 2 image added incorrectly, do via mkdocs next time
 - FOR NEXT ITERATION: image in guest profiles step 2. need to add via mkdocs. the one with two guest profile links circled.
 - NOTE: all image maps are agents, guest profiles, managers, messages, staff console

2) Fill out the form with information corresponding to the user you wish to add. If the user is already in the system they will simply be added to this hotel, if not already in the system they will receive a confirmation email. If you'd like to give this user manager capabilities (see [Managers](./Managers.html)), make sure the _**'Manager'**_ checkbox is checked. If you would like this user to receive notifications when guests text in, make sure the _**'Get immediate notifications'**_ checkbox is checked. Click _**'SEND AN INVITATION'**_ when you have completed the form.

3) If the user was not already in the system, you will see this message on the following page. If they are already in the system, they should be added to the hotel right away without an email invite.

![](./img/emailmsg.png)

Also the user who was invited will see an email similar to the one below

![](./img/invitestaffemail2.png)

4) Once the user who was added confirms by clicking the **_Accept Invitation_** link in the email, they will be added to the list of users at the hotel. You can see their name on the list of users at the bottom of the screen.

###**_<a name="managing-users">Managing Users</a>_**

1) After completing [Setup Hotel Details](./Setup-Hotel-Details.html) or following from step two at the [top of the page](#manage-users) you will see the Manage Users page for the hotel you selected. Here you can see the form to invite users, and at the bottom of the page can see the list of current users at the hotel.

2) As a manager, you are able to remove or change the role of a user.

2a) To remove a user's role, simply click the X next to their name, and then select OK in the pop up window.

![](./img/removeuserrole.png)

You will see the user will be removed from the list of users at the hotel ![](./img/userroleremoved.png)

2b) To change the role of a user, simply click the role you would like that user to have. Each user has their current role in the same row as their name. If there is one role, that is their role. If there are two roles, the user's role is the one highlighted in green text.

![](./img/userroles.png)

Agents have the ability to access the [Staff Console](./Staff-Console.html) and [Check Guests In](./Checking-A-Guest-In.html), while Manager abilities are outlined on [Managers](./Managers.html) page.

For example lets change person from agent to manager. We click on `manager` in the role column for the user `person` and click OK in the pop up window.

![](./img/changeuserrole.png)

You will see that `manager` has gone from grey to green, indicating that the user's role is now manager

Otherwise, to setup messaging, log in with a manager account for the hotel you wish to setup messaging for. Upon log in, you should see a list of hotels this manager account is associated with. Click the 'MANAGE' button and then form the drop down menu click 'Messaging' to continue to setup messaging

![](./img/settingupivy2.png)

3) On the next screen you can see the welcome message Ivy automatically sends to your guests, and the responses she gives as well. This is non-editable. Click the 'SAVE & NEXT' button to continue.

![](./img/welcomingyourguests.png)

4) On the next screen you are able to set up Ivy smart responses for your guests. You can provide a response for specific subjects, like `pool` or `wifi`, or contact our staff to set up responses for additional scenarios. Click the 'SAVE & NEXT' button to continue.

![](./img/smartresponses.png)

5) On the next screen you are able to create message templates. Message templates are exactly what they sound like, a predetermined message that you can quickly send to guests without having to type the content each time. Templates can serve as common responses related to specific situations. For example if a guest asks for a cot you can create a template that replies " Thank you. We have notified housekeeping and a cot will be up shortly." As seen on the page, you can include {guest_name} or {hotel_name} in your template - when the guest receives the message {guest_name} appears as their name (example John Smith), and {hotel_name} appears as the property name (example Camelot Inn and Suites). Message template usage is further documented at [Viewing Sending Messages to Guests](./Viewing-Sending-Messages-to-Guests.html). After clicking add new template, you can provide the name of the template and the message content in the dropdown. Click the 'SAVE & NEXT' button to continue.

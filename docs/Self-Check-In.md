### Self Check In

Properties are able to send welcome messages to their guests. Within the welcome message, there is a link which gives the guest the ability to check themselves in. Self check in is enabled by default, please [contact GoMoment staff](mailto:support@gomoment.com?Subject=Self%20Check-in) to turn this feature off.

1)  With self check in enabled, guests are able to self check in through the UI. Once logged in, click the self check in option from the drop down menu in the top right hand corner.

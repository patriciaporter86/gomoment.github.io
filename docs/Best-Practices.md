# **TOP 5 THINGS OUR BEST HOTELS ARE DOING**

"What every hotel front desk staff should know!"

**1\. ASK EVERY GUEST FOR THEIR MOBILE NUMBER AT CHECK-IN**

> We cannot text anyone if we do not have their numbers

**2\. REPLY EVEN WHEN YOU CANNOT RESOLVE IT RIGHT AWAY**

> “Hi, Mr Jones, this is Patricia at the front desk, I received your request and am working on it now.”

**3\. RESOLVE REQUESTS IN 10 MINS**

> This notifies other team members that the issue is in good hands and only resolve if the issue resulted in a happy outcome.

**4\. REPLY TO COMPLAINTS IMMEDIATELY**

> “Hi Mr. Jones This is Patricia at the front desk, how can I improve your stay?

**5\. BRAG THAT YOU’RE TEXT FRIENDLY:**

> "We have a free upgrade that allows you to text with our virtual guest services rep, Ivy. You can order towels, make requests, or ask questions. What's your cell phone number so I can make sure you're able to text her?"

> "We can send you the wifi password over text, what is your cell phone so I can get this sent to you?"

**_Guest Profiles_**

1)  One can easily view the profiles of any guest, at any hotel. See the [Staff Console](./Staff-Console/#getting-to-the-console) for the hotel at which you would like to view Guest Profiles.

2)  Once at the Staff Console, for any tab -- checked in, scheduled, unverified, checked out, you can click on the circle containing the guest's initials to view their profile. For example:

3)  After clicking on the guest's intials, you will be brought to their profile page which will look similar to the photo below.
